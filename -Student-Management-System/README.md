### Project Overview

 This project is created to manage student records for School.
Here, 


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I got to know how to solve basic Python problems. In this project, I applied the following concepts:

-  Mathematical operations
-  List operations
-  Dictionary operations
-  String indexing and formatting.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 - Collection of data

 combined the student's name data from two classes.

- Generation of Progress report

created a dictionary for single student say 'Geoffrey Hinton' in each subject with marks scored in each subject,where key is subject name and score is value. calculated his percentage.So,The Progress Report is generated.

-Scholarship for topper in MATHEMATICS

For the student who has got the highest marks in Mathametics subject, the school has decided to award a Scholarship.
so, We've to check who performed best in mathematics from all the students who appeared for the test.
Create a dictionary named 'mathematics' using student name as a key and score in mathematics as values .
Found out the student with highest marks in Mathematics and stored it in a variable 'Topper'.

- Scholarship certificate

Now, We have to print the name of topper student from previou task on a certificate but as print his last name and then his first name.
Using Split function splitted the topper string and extracted first name and last name.
Converted it into uppercase in order to print in certifiacate.




### Challenges faced

 faced problems to store data into variable which is result of splitted string.
solved this issue using following commnds:

`topper = 'andrew ng'
first_name = topper.split()[0]
last_name = topper.split()[1]`


### Additional pointers

 Finally, Successfully built Student Management System.
